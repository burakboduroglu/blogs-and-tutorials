## Definitions üå≥

- `What is MongoDB?`

> MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.

- `What is a Database?`

> A database holds a set of collections. A database typically has a separate file system directory to hold its data. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. Generally, you associate a database with one application.

- `What is a Collection?`

> A collection is a group of documents. If a document is the MongoDB analog of a row in a relational database table, then a collection is the analog of a table.

- `What is a Document?`

> A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

- `What is a Field?`

> A document has a dynamic schema. Dynamic schemas allow documents in the same collection to have different sets of fields and to have different field names for the common fields.

- `What is a Primary Key?`

> In MongoDB, each document stored in a collection requires a unique \_id field that acts as a primary key. If an inserted document omits the \_id field, the MongoDB driver automatically generates an ObjectId for the \_id field.

- `Why use NoSQL?`

> NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. This makes NoSQL databases ideal for storing and processing unstructured data.

- `Why use MongoDB?`

> MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. We believe this is the most natural way to think about data, and is much more expressive and powerful than the traditional row/column model.
